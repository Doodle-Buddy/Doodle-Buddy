Doodle Buddy is a game where a player is prompted with a game word in which the player attempts to draw. The other players in the room attempt to guess the object being drawn. This app utilizes Websockets via Socket.io, uses a MySQL as a database, is rendered using Handlebars, and is served by Express.
